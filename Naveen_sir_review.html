            First of all, a praiseworthy work it is, for the very nature of questions you have picked up and the justice you tried to serve to the theme. Having queries in mind regarding the truth and the world around is one of the core features of a living human. Happy to learn an engineering student keeps these features alive in him, and acknowledges the contribution of Cultural Education sessions offered at the varsity.

                <strong>Structure wise</strong>, it is nicely crafted in a style that suits mostly to cerebral kinda literary discussion. Not too much technical like research papers, not too simple to be called a popular writeup. Building an argument around a solid question/query or a hypothesis is one of the known best methods of academic/semi-academic write-ups. You have effectively followed the same. I have also noticed your sincere efforts in producing examples to make your concepts clear to the reader. However, the writing could have been a bit more sophisticated in terms of sentence structure, usage of words (verbose at places), and choosing examples.
            </li>

                <strong>Presentation of the theme</strong> with utmost adherence to logical methods, both inductive and deductive, is very impressive. I understand your orientation as an engineer mostly clings to reasoning and logical argumentation, and also, I suppose, this would make sense to the broader engineering community too. There are certain flaws in the argumentation, which could have been evaded by thorough study. But you have taken anticipatory bail at the outset; that you have not gotten any systematic exposure to the world of philosophy. 🙂

                <strong>Factuality of the content</strong> presented holds good at many places and requires fine tuning elsewhere.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Your understanding of observable phenomena</strong> is appreciable. The concepts introduced, such as high grade and low grade truths, sensible philosophy and non-sensible philosophy, are appreciable too.
            </li>

        <h3>Suggestions:</h3>
        <p>
            While it is understandable that the argumentative method embraced in the article aims to address technical minds, it is to be kept in mind always that the logic can take you only up to a certain point in the journey of knowledge seeking. The rest needs textual study, guidance of Guru and the grace of deities.
        </p>
        <p>
            More exposure to life and proper textual understanding would help you figure out a satisfying answer to the question or the doubtability of the claim <em>'The side of Dharma always wins in the end'</em>.
        </p>
        
        <p>All the best.</p>
