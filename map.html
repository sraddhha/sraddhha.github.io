          <h2> The Question</h2>
          <p>If we can imagine all of the knowledge that we could know, how would that look like? How much can we know ‚Äî leaving aside whether we have the ability to know it or not?</p>
          <p>To answer this question, think fundamentally of how we attain knowledge.Knowledge is factual information ‚Äî only the information that is true ‚Äî that which really happened, happens, or will happen ‚Äî is knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q2" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q2-anchor"></span>
          <h2> The Source of Knowledge ‚Äî The Five Senses</h2>
          <p>We humans attain knowledge fundamentally through our five senses:<br>vision,  hearing,  smell,  taste, and  touch.</p>
          <P>Imagine a 3D map lying on a table, showing all the places on Earth.<br>Now imagine a blue aura spread across it ‚Äî whatever the aura touches, we have the sensory knowledge of that place.<br>The aura covers the entire map.</P>
          <P>Now imagine we had the sensory information ‚Äî the data of these five senses ‚Äî for all places in the universe, across past, present, and future.<br>We would know how everything looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels across space and time.</P>
          <p>Would that mean we have all knowledge?</p>
          <p>No.<br>We would only have raw sensory information, not understanding.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q3" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q3-anchor"></span>
          <h2> The Sixth Sense ‚Äî Intellect</h2>
          <p>If asked why things fall downwards, a person with only sensory data might know that things fall, but not the reason.</p>
          <p>Humans have a sixth sense ‚Äî the intellect, which processes sensory information, observes patterns, and creates new knowledge from existing knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q4" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q4-anchor"></span>
          <h2> How Intellect Creates Knowledge ‚Äî A Simple Example</h2>
          <p>A newborn sees his mother daily:<br>One day, she appears as a blue giant.<br>The next, as a yellow giant.<br>(It‚Äôs the same mother wearing different sarees!)</p>
          <p>Through pattern recognition, the baby learns that despite the color change, the face and voice remain constant.<br>He deduces that this constant being is ‚Äúmother.‚Äù</p>
          <p>Thus, the mother is not just a sensory object ‚Äî she is a pattern recognized by intellect.<br>This is a high-grade object ‚Äî something abstracted from sensory data.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q5" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q5-anchor"></span>
          <h2> Low-Grade vs. High-Grade Knowledge</h2>
          <p><strong>Low-grade knowledge</strong> = direct sensory truths (what we see, hear, etc.)<br><strong>High-grade knowledge</strong> = truths about patterns observed from sensory data.</p>
          <p>Examples of high-grade objects:</p>
          <p><strong>Season</strong><br><strong>Year</strong><br><strong>Dharma</strong><br><strong>Magnetism</strong></p>
          <p>These cannot be directly sensed ‚Äî their effects can be, but not the concept itself.</p>
          <p>High-grade knowledge emerges only when something changes while something else remains consistent, allowing pattern recognition.</p>
          <p class = "special">üß© ‚ÄúAll knowledge is patterns deduced from patterns deduced from patterns deduced from sensory information.‚Äù</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q6" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q6-anchor"></span>
          <h2>Example ‚Äî Newton and Gravity</h2>
          <p>Newton observes:<br><strong>Apples fall down.</strong><br><strong>The Sun and  Moon don‚Äôt.</strong></p>
          <p>By noticing this difference ‚Äî something changes (behavior of objects) ‚Äî he deduces:</p>
          <p class = "special">‚ÄúGravity acts on all objects that have mass and decreases with the distance between them.‚Äù</p>
          <p>This is a high-grade truth because:<br>It explains why apples fall.<br>It predicts other truths (like objects falling on Mars).</pr>
          <p>Thus, a single high-grade truth is more powerful than countless low-grade truths.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q7" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q7-anchor"></span>
          <h2> The Pyramid of Knowledge</h2>
          <p>Now imagine that blue aura from earlier rising upward, forming a pyramid.<br><strong>The base</strong> = sensory information.<br><strong>The higher levels</strong> = higher-grade knowledge derived from patterns.</p>
          <div class="image-block square">
            <img src="images/TMOAK-diagram.png" alt="Illustration of the Pyramid of Knowledge">
            <p>Fig. 1 ‚Äî Representation of the Pyramid of Knowledge: from sensory data to eternal truths.</p>
          </div>
          <p>To climb up the pyramid is to ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù ‚Äî to deduce higher truths.<br>To climb down is to apply those truths to predict lower ones.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q8" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q8-anchor"></span>
          <h2> The Peak ‚Äî Eternal Truths</h2>
          <p>What lies at the top of the pyramid?</p>
          <p>When we run out of patterns to observe ‚Äî when everything becomes consistent and nothing changes ‚Äî we reach truths that cannot be further explained.</p>
          <p>These are Eternal Truths ‚Äî facts that never change and whose causes are unknown.</p>
          <p>Examples:<br>Opposite poles of magnets attract.<br>Gravity acts on all objects with mass.</p>
          <p>We don‚Äôt know why they are true ‚Äî we just know they always are.<br>Hence, we call them Laws ‚Äî like the Law of Gravitation.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q9" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q9-anchor"></span>
          <h2> Many Domains, Many Eternal Truths</h2>
          <p>Physics deals with non-living nature,<br>Biology with life,<br>Social sciences with societies.</p>
          <p>Each domain contains its own eternal truths, which define its foundation.</p>
          <p>If someone had all sensory data, did all pattern recognition, and reached every eternal truth, would they possess all knowledge?</p>
          <p>No.<br>Because there is knowledge beyond sensory data and intellect.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q10" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q10-anchor"></span>
          <h2> Beyond the Pyramid ‚Äî Spiritual Knowledge</h2>
          <p>There exists a form of knowledge not derived from the senses ‚Äî called Spiritual Knowledge.</p>
          <p>Spiritual knowledge cannot be gained through pattern recognition or sensory data.</p>
          <p>Imagine:</p>
          <p class = "special">A world where everything is completely red.<br>If all is red, no one can even know what ‚Äúred‚Äù means, because nothing differs.</p>
          <p>Only if one becomes aware of the common essence present everywhere ‚Äî that is spiritual awareness.</p>
          <p>Thus, spiritual knowledge is about experiencing what is constant and unchanging in all existence.</p>
          <p>This knowledge cannot fit inside the pyramid ‚Äî it stands separate from it.<br>Or, perhaps, it could be seen as the pinnacle above it ‚Äî the ultimate, unchanging truth.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q11" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q11-anchor"></span>
          <h2> Philosophy ‚Äî The Ascent of Knowledge</h2>
          <p>Whenever someone seeks to climb up the pyramid ‚Äî trying to reach eternal truths and explain the lower ones ‚Äî they are doing Philosophy.</p>
          <p>Philosophy breaks the habit of living within low-grade truths and instead reasons from the fundamental ones.<br>It seeks to extend understanding deeper ‚Äî toward the highest-grade knowledge.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="q12" class="card">
          <span class="anchor" id="q12-anchor"></span>
          <h2> The Philosophy of Life ‚Äî The Center of All Knowledge</h2>
          <p>This document discusses the philosophy of life ‚Äî the knowledge of life itself.</p>
          <p>The purpose of man‚Äôs reasoning and knowledge is to live better ‚Äî to rise beyond primitive existence.</p>
          <p>Philosophy of life aims to explain:</p>
          <p>Why life is the way it is<br>What goals we pursue<br>Why we pursue them<br>What happens when we reach them</p>
          <p>All other knowledge helps us achieve goals,<br>but the philosophy of life helps us choose the right goals.</p>
          <p>Such knowledge often comes from religion, not science ‚Äî because science excludes the spiritual dimension, without which the philosophy of life remains incomplete.</p>
